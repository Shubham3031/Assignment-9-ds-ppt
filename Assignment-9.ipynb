    "# 1.Ans.Neuron vs. Neural Network:\n",
    "A neuron is a basic building block of a neural network. It is an individual unit that receives input signals,\n",

    "of interconnected neurons that work together to process and learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Ans.Structure and components of a neuron:\n",
    "A neuron consists of three main components: dendrites, a cell body (soma), and an axon. The dendrites receive\n",
    "input signals from other neurons or external sources. The cell body integrates these signals and performs \n",
    "computations. The axon transmits the output signal, called the action potential, to other neurons or target cells.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 4.Ans.Difference between perceptron and multilayer perceptron:\n",
